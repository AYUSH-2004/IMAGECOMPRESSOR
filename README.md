üõ°Ô∏è Security
The primary security feature of PixelShrink is its client-side architecture. Since no data is ever transmitted to a server, users can be confident that their images remain private and secure on their own devices. This approach eliminates the risks associated with data breaches and unauthorized access on servers.
